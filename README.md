## What is IBM Cloud?
Provides over 190 services that allow you to build and customize your applications. The catalog provides free services in networking, containers, computing, analytics, machine learning, blockchain, databases, devops, internet of things, security and mobile. You can use the dashboard or the CLI (Command Line Interface) to create and work with these services. 
 
## How do I sign up?
If you are attending an event, please ask the IBM organizer or mentor for a link to sign up for a free account.

## Is it free?
A lot services on IBM Cloud have the lite tier, that you can use with your free IBM Cloud account. Lite accounts 
- **don't have an expiration date**, **don't require a credit card** and 
- **provide limited access to a catalog of more than 40 services**, 
- **including IBM Watson® APIs.**

### Machine Learning
#### [Natural Language Understanding](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-natural-language-understanding)

> Analyze various features of text content at scale. Provide text, raw HTML, or a public URL and IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding will give you results for the features you request. The service cleans HTML content before analysis by default, so the results can ignore most advertisements and other unwanted content.

#### [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/)

> Watson Assistant is a conversation AI platform that helps you provide customers with fast, straightforward and accurate answers to their questions, across any application, device or channel. Most chatbots try to mimic human interactions, frustrating customers when a misunderstanding arises. Watson Assistant is more than a chatbot. It knows when to search for an answer from a knowledge base, when to ask for clarity and when to direct users to a human. And since it can be deployed in any cloud or on-premises environment – smarter AI is finally available wherever you need it.
